# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer: iteration means you are doing an action a certain amount of times or until your condition is met 

  Researched answer: process of performing a specific action a set amount of times or until a condition is met



2. The built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: maps predefined parameters I believe are value,index, and array and I belive you only need value

  Researched answer: The parameters are indeed value,index and array. The required parameter .map() uses is value and that is because it is extracting the "values" at every index to refactor into a new array.



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: object destructuring is accessing specific values within an object 

  Researched answer: Object destructuring is unpacking values from an object and assigning them specific variables.



4. What is the difference between an object and a class?

  Your answer: A class is the framework an object uses to base itself off of.

  Researched answer: A class defines object properties and default values for those properties. An object is an instance of a class.



5. Why would you use the method super()?

  Your answer: The method super() brings in all the properties created by the parent class and inputs them into a child class.

  Researched answer: The super method passes attributes from the parent classes constructor.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I have no idea what hoisting means in JavaScript im going to assume it involves pushing your JS code? Let me research the subject and I will present you with a refined answer on the lower line.

  Researched answer: Hoisting is saving declarations of variables and functions and "pre-storing" similar to moving them to the top of your code but without actually moving it. Useful for calling functions before declaring them in your code.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. React: React is a JavaScript library used for building user interface.

2. React lifecycle methods: The series of events happening from the beginning to the end of a react component: mounting, updating, unmounting. 

3. React state: An object that stores a components data and determines how the component renders and behaves.

4. Component invocation/call: Requires two steps first the component has to be imported then it is called in a return. 
When a component is first called or any changes are made to the component the render function is called which builds jsx that react puts on the page 

5. DOM Events: Document Object Model "DOM" a signal that something has happened or is happening and can be triggered by a user or browser.
